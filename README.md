# Red Wine Analysis

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing various characteristics of red wine to understand factors that influence wine quality. Using Python for data analysis and visualization, we explore features like acidity, sugar content, and pH level to uncover insights related to wine quality.

## Data Source
The dataset contains detailed information on different chemical properties of red wine samples, including pH, alcohol level, sugar content, and acidity. This data enables an in-depth analysis of the qualities that contribute to wine ratings.

## Project Objectives
1. Analyze the chemical composition of red wine samples.
2. Identify correlations between wine quality and specific chemical properties.
3. Use data visualization to interpret findings and highlight patterns.

## Requirements
Make sure to install the following libraries:
```bash
pip install pandas seaborn matplotlib scikit-learn
